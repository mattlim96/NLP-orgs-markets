# Problem set 2 â€” README

## Context

Consider the [ai_in_finance.json][1] file, containing 4K+ articles dealing with
the topics of  AI & financial services from The Wall Street Journal and The
Financial Times. For a description of the corpus, see [Lanzolla, Gianvito,
Simone Santoni, and Christopher Tucci. "Unlocking value from AI in financial
services: strategic and organizational tradeoffs vs. media narratives." In
Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Value Creation. Edward Elgar Publishing,
2021.][2]

## Problem

Use the BoW or TFIDF approach to transform each document (i.e., article) in the
corpus into a vector. Then, use the dimensionality reduction technique of your
choice (see [scikit-learn capabilities][3]) to visualize the position of the
individual documents in the vector space. You may also want to color-code the
positions on the basis of document-level attributes (e.g., year of publication).
