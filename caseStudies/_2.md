# Gender-based stereotypes in job posts

**Context**

You work for a consultancy company that has been asked to quantify the extent to
which job post descriptions mirror gender-based stereotypes — that is, they
contain words that have a connotation in terms of gender. Your client is a
governmental agency dealing with labor policy issues.

**Expectations**

You’re supposed to work with the [Indeed Job Posting Dataset][1] available in
Kaggle to appreciate:

- how/to what extent job descriptions show a gender stereotype
- the extent to which the magnitude of the gender stereotype changes across job
titles, ranks, sectors, and so on and so forth.
